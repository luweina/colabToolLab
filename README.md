Q1: Why are readme's in github in the .md format? What is .md and why does github
use it instead of .txt, .html .docx, or any other file format?

.md stands for Markdown Documentation File An MD file is a text file created using one of several
possible dialects of the Markdown language.
Github uses it is because it saved in plain text format but includes inline
text symbols that define how to format the text MD files are designed for authoring plain text
documentation that can be easily converted to HTML.

Q2: Is the keyword "fixes" the only way to auto-close an issue from a PR
(pull request). Is there other keywords that can accomplish the same thing?

No, it is not the only way to auto-close an issue, keyword like
close
closes
closed
fix
fixes
fixed
resolve
resolves
resolved
can also accomplish the same thing

Q3: Do you have to create a new PR EVERYTIME you want to close an issue,
or is it possible to close multiple issues within a single PR? If so,
how?

no, multiple issues can be closed in a single pull request. In the body message, we can
say "close #1 close #2 close #3" etc
